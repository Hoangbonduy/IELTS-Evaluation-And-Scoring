However, it is considered efficient compared to conventional face-to-face lessons colleges and universities offer. While some argue that lessons can never access the quality of in-person education, Online learning programs can be just as beneficial in the same situation, a particular circumstance.First, online education programs ensure flexibility and convenience that traditional face-to-face class opportunities sometimes need to be improved. With an online connection, students can access lesson things at their own tempo from any location. This plasticity is especially beneficial for people with other missions, such as work or family responsibilities; for example, stay-at-home parents can follow higher education without compromising their parental responsibilities by registering for distance learning lessons.Secondly, technological advancements in remote learning platforms have significantly improved the quality of distance education. Online tools such as virtual lessons, debate forums, social media content, and media resources have led to engaging learning environments that encourage active participation and teamwork among students. For instance, Cambly is an online website that students meet up with native English instructors at any time and place.Taking everything into account, from the arguments and examples given I firmly believe that online lessons consist of crucial and useful tools besides methods due to the fact that they have flexibility and functionality.\",\n          \"In all countries around the globe armed police personnel are common. However, the necessity of arming them is debatable. Some people claim that it leads to the unprecedented attack on common people and perhaps to state terrorism and violence, while I concur with the side of those who argue that it is essential to maintain law and order. The reasons are manifold for my support  will be discussed in this essay.On the one hand, I totally disagree with the notion that state terrorism is raising because of armed police officers. In fact, many people who believe this notion are not ready to understand the fact that the police department is directly controlled by the home department of government. And thus there are myriad public councils are working to strictly monitor the judicial use of these weapons by police officers. Additionally, these people often come with an example of some random police encounters with common people. Although these incidents are true, I believe these are mostly accidental and the police officers who are responsible for these also have been punished severely for their negligence.On the other hand, the country's entire internal security management is under the control of the police department. In order to maintain these superiorly, they are in the need to develop some sort of fear among people. This fear in my opinion is healthy for the betterment of society. Furthermore, police and state security forces are the first-line workers who need to witness some dangerous situations. Despite their personal well-being, they work towards the welfare and security of the people. For example, recently one of the police inspectors in my neighbourhood was brutally attacked by some petty thieves during a situation when he tried to arrest them for shoplifting. This incident made me  think in favour of armed police officers that if he was allowed to carry his weapon, he would have got prevented  the attack.In conclusion, not only do armed police officers use their weapons to maintain law and order, but also for their self-protection. Therefore, I totally agree that arming  police officers will never lead to state terrorism or violence, in fact, it prevents these.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

Although some believe that violence in the media is what causes the increase in juvenile crime, some other causes should be taken into account as well.  \\n There are a number of reasons why juvenile crime is growing. First, since most teenagers nowadays have access to the Internet, juvenile crime becomes more organized, well-planned and secure than it was in the past.  For example, most of the recruitment or crime planning work can be done seamlessly through a social network channel that vows to protect user\\u2019s privacy, making it a challenge for the police to prevent real crime in advance.  Second, some large cities, like Chicago, are rife with drug trafficking targeting young adults. Plenty of evidence suggests that human\\u2019s brains are susceptible to the negative influence of drugs, which often triggers the desire to commit juvenile crime.  \\n Nevertheless, there are also a variety of solutions to alleviate this issue. First, Internet police can disguise themselves as normal young adults who wish to join those illegal groups for investigation and evidence gathering purposes. The police would have the opportunity to not only prevent the particular crime beforehand but also understand the underlying structure behind any contemporary juvenile delinquency. Second, law enforcement should take step to tighten drug control to ensure little to no drug supply in the market. For instance, increasing fines and penalties for drug-related activities would act as a deterrent for drug traffickers and buyers. \\n In conclusion, the Internet and the drug industry are two contributing factors to juvenile crime. Internet police and law enforcement should cooperate to minimize the issue to a manageable level.\",\n          \"Nowadays, the production of goods is increasing considerably, and is causing a series of problems to the nature. This essay will discuss the reasons for this phenomenon, and also the possible solutions.\\n\\nThere are two main reasons related to the impact of production to the environment. One of these is because of the lack of environmental regulations to protect the nature. It is well known that our rules do not support all aspects related to the damage caused by production in large scale. For instance, there are numerous industries in S\\u00e3o Paulo that through their gabage in the river, and nothing happens. Furthermore, the industries do not invest in developing new technologies to make their processes more efficient, and more environmental friendly.\\n\\nHowever, there are solutions to this issue. Firstly, the government should apply more taxes to those companies that do not respect environmental regulations. For example, the rules applied in Brazil are too soft when compared to developed countries like Canada. Another important point is that we should have more aducation actions focused on environmental solutions that would make our industrial process greener. For instance, universities should invest in researches to increase the manufacturing efficiency.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the absence of laws and regulations to protect the nature against the impact of production, and also the lack of technology to improve efficiency, are the key aspects of the problem. Nevertheless, if the government apply regulations focused on environmental actions, and also invest in technology, this situation could be solved.\",\n          \"Some professionals think that the residents will not satisfied with any additional growth in the economy since this nation is already wealthy. In my opinion, I firmly disagree with this statement because while there is a limit that money can bring to us, the increase in economic wealth still makes the citizens more delightful.\\n\\nFirst of all, one of the reasons why I think the enhancement of Economic wealth still makes people happy is because there will more problems to tackle. As a result of the countries being rich, there will more issues will exist especially about the social. For instance, nowadays, the authorities and the residents need to face traffic congestion and pollution as a consequence of people will tend to buy more and more cars than ever, if the nation is rich, they can supply and encourage their populations to commute by vehicles which use environmentally friendly energy. Moreover, if the country is wealthy, it can provide the latest technology in many categories such as healthcare and education which makes people\\u2019s satisfaction grow. \\n\\nIn contrast, sometimes economic growth will not make people more cheerful cause of the rise of the nation\\u2019s economy just a part of their life besides their well-being and relationships. For example, while a person is vibrant, they are a patient who is facing an illness that can not be treated so they will not have true satisfaction. In addition, we used to have money to meet our necessary needs such as food and a place to live, so when all our needs are supplied we will not care about money anymore.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I can't entirely agree with the statement that the citizens will not satisfied with the economic growth due to the fact that they have used to it because there will be more problems in a developed country than usual so we need money to solve it and also the government can supply the best things for their residents\\u2019s essential needs in life.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Task Achievement\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.480406094424371,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 9.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7.0,\n          5.0,\n          4.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Coherence and Cohesion\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.6416043157408278,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 9.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7.5,\n          4.5,\n          3.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Lexical Resource\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.8825014271565612,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 30.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 17,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7.0,\n          4.0,\n          3.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Grammatical Range and Accuracy\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 127.02990107661684,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 2015.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 21,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7.0,\n          2015.0,\n          2.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"embedding\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": null,\n        \"max\": null,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 0,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
